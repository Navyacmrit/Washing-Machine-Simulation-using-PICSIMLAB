The simulation replicates the core functionality of a washing machine, providing insights into control system design, automation, and simulation techniques for embedded systems.
This project focuses on simulating a washing machine using PicsimLab, aiming to replicate real-world washing machine functionality in a virtual environment. The project begins with a comprehensive understanding of washing machine components, cycles, and operations. Parameters defining laundry status, such as fabric type, load size, and water level, are identified.

Technologies: PIC16F877A Microcontroller PicsimLab (Simulation Environment)

Prerequisites: MPLAB X IDE (or a compatible PIC development environment) PicsimLab Simulator

Development: Write your microcontroller code in MPLAB using assembly or C. Compile and assemble your code to generate a HEX file.

Simulation: Load the HEX file into PicsimLab. Configure the simulated peripherals (display, sensors, motor) if needed. Run the simulation to observe the washing machine control system in action.
